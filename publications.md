	    <h4>Deep Graph Clustering via Dual Correlation Reduction</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p align="justify"> Deep graph clustering, which aims to reveal the underlying graph structure and divide the nodes into different groups, has attracted intensive attention in recent years. However, in the process of node encoding, existing methods suffer from representation collapse which tends to map all data into the same representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised deep graph clustering method termed DCRN by reducing information correlation in a dual manner. Specifically, by forcing the cross-view sample correlation matrix and cross-view feature correlation matrix to approximate two identity matrices, respectively, we reduce the information correlation in the dual-level, thus improving the discriminative capability of the resulting features.</p>
